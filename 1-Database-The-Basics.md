# 1-Database-The-Basics


## What is a Database?
A database is a collection of data that holds the data in the form of tables. It is designed to store, organize, and manage large amounts of information efficiently.

- **Table:** A way of storing data in rows and columns, similar to an Excel spreadsheet.
- **Access & Manipulation:** Databases not only store data but also provide ways to access, retrieve, update, and manipulate it.

## Why use a Database instead of Excel?
- Excel is suitable for small datasets, but becomes unmanageable with thousands of spreadsheets or large records.
- Databases provide better management, scalability, and additional functionalities for handling large and complex data.


## Types of Databases
| Type                | Description                                                      | Example Databases                         |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Relational Database | Stores data in rows and columns; tables have relations            | MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MariaDB |
| Non-Relational (NoSQL) | Key-value, document, or graph-based; tables do not have relations | HBase, MongoDB, Cassandra, etc.           |

### Relational vs. Non-Relational
- **Relational:** Data is stored in tables (rows and columns) with relationships between tables (e.g., employee and department tables linked by department ID).
- **Non-Relational:** Data is stored as key-value pairs, documents, or graphs. Tables do not have relations among them.


## Q&A
**Q: What is a table in a database?**

A: A table stores data in rows and columns, similar to an Excel sheet.

**Q: Why not use Excel for large data?**

A: Excel is not scalable for large datasets; databases offer better management and features.

**Q: What is a relational database?**

A: A database where data is stored in tables with relationships between them. Examples: MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL.

**Q: What is a NoSQL database?**

A: A database that does not use tables with relations; uses key-value, document, or graph storage. Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, HBase.

**Q: How do databases differ?**

A: Mainly in features (like security, performance, etc.), not in SQL syntax. SQL is the common language for relational databases.


## Key Points
- Databases allow storing, accessing, and manipulating data.
- Relational databases use SQL for interaction.
- SQL is the standard language for relational databases.
- Choice of database depends on features, not SQL syntax.
